</div>

Based on existing main dark color <span style="color:#000E2B">(#000E2B)</span> as background to add scientific but vivid style,in the meanwhile express the similar meaning for abstract business events.

To emphasis the sense of scientific, I choosed different blue style and combined with purple to balance the banner style more suit for website
